# K-means-Clustering_OpenMpi_Parallel Processing
is a method of vector quantization that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid ), serving as a prototype of the cluster


## Requirements:
   1-Number of data points(which point are in 2 dimension (X,Y) )
   
   2-file to read point
   
   3-Number of Clusters and for first time  i Initiate 2 random numbers(X,Y) for each cluster  (assume number of clusters equal number of threads)
   
   4-using mean square error to calculate distance
